- 9-10: Highly complex reasoning requiring extensive research

Question types:
- factual: Direct fact lookup
- analytical: Requires analysis and synthesis
- comparative: Comparing multiple entities/concepts
- multi_domain: Spans multiple knowledge domains
- complex_reasoning: Requires multi-step logical reasoning

Evidence types: documents, data, regulations, procedures, examples, comparisons, etc.

Main Question: {question}
Question Analysis: {analysis}
Current Context Hints: {context_hints}
Information Gaps: {gaps}

Generate 3-5 focused sub-questions that will help gather comprehensive information. Each sub-question should:
1. Target specific aspects of the main question
2. Be answerable with document retrieval
3. Build upon or complement other sub-questions
4. Address identified gaps

# Context Quality Assessment Prompt
CONTEXT_ASSESSMENT_PROMPT = """You are an expert context evaluator. Assess the quality and completeness of retrieved context for answering the question.

Question: {question}

Scoring guidelines:
- quality_score: Relevance and accuracy of information (0=irrelevant, 1=highly relevant)
- coverage_score: How well the context covers question aspects (0=no coverage, 1=complete coverage)
- evidence_strength: Reliability and authority of sources (0=weak, 1=strong)

Sufficiency levels:
- insufficient: Cannot answer the question adequately
- partial: Can provide partial answer but missing key information
- sufficient: Can provide good answer with available information
- comprehensive: Can provide complete, well-supported answer

Question: {question}
Current Iteration: {iteration}

Context Assessment: {assessment}
Recent Retrieval Success: {recent_success}
Question Complexity: {complexity}

Consider these factors:
1. Context quality and coverage scores
2. Information gaps and their importance
3. Diminishing returns from recent retrievals
4. Question complexity vs. current evidence
5. Resource efficiency

- No new relevant information in last 2 hops
- Reached complexity-based maximum iterations

Instructions:
1. Synthesize information from multiple sources
2. Weight evidence based on source reliability
3. Address all aspects of the question
4. Handle any contradictions explicitly
5. Indicate confidence level
6. Provide clear source attribution
7. If the question relates to trade finance discrepancy finding, analyze the context deeply for discrepancies

Structure your answer as:
- Main answer (comprehensive and well-organized)
- Key supporting evidence
- Source attribution
- Confidence assessment
- Any limitations or caveats
Answer only from the provided context. If context is insufficient for any aspect, explicitly state what information is missing.

# Advanced Verification Prompt
ADVANCED_VERIFICATION_PROMPT = """You are an expert answer verifier. Thoroughly verify if the answer is properly grounded in the provided context.

Question: {question}
Answer: {answer}
Context: {context}

Perform multi-level verification:

1. **Factual Grounding**: Are all factual claims supported by the context?
2. **Logical Consistency**: Is the reasoning logically sound?
3. **Completeness**: Does the answer address all aspects of the question?
4. **Source Attribution**: Are sources properly cited?
5. **Confidence Calibration**: Is the stated confidence appropriate?

Provide verification results in JSON format:
